# `eurex` — evidence

- **Kind:** `MarketHoursKey`
- **Owner module:** [`europe.rs`](../../src/calendar/schedules/futures/international/europe.rs)
- **Source sets:** [`EU-EUREX`](../schedules/sources.md#eu-eurex)
- **Ledger row:** [verification.md](../schedules/verification.md)

## Ledger basis (moved from docs/schedules/verification.md on 2026-09-12 UTC)

FESX/FDAX/FDXM benchmark-index futures; the dated key API reuses the sourced January-2010 baseline, 2018 extension, and recurring CET/CEST phase selection.

## Revision rows

None. `europe.rs` carries no `revisions!` block for this identity; its 2018-12-10 Asian-hours cutover and the seasonal CET/CEST choice are encoded as comparisons inside `eurex_profile_at` instead.

The key selects through the same `eurex_profile_at` function as the `eurex`
exchange row: a date comparison against the 2018-12-10 Asian-hours cutover,
then a UTC-offset comparison that picks the CET or CEST phase table. Eurex
circular 088/2018 states the cutover day unconditionally at T1, so the date is
sourced even though it is not carried as a tuple.

## Dated selectors

Day-level boundaries this identity's `profile_at` selects on directly, outside
any `revisions!` block. They are invisible to the module-declaration fences, so
they are recorded here in revision-row grammar and checked against
`HISTORICAL_CUTOVERS` / `HISTORICAL_INSTANT_CUTOVERS` in
`tests/contract/session_invariants/historical_expectations.rs`.

- 2018-12-10 — T1 — Eurex circular 088/2018 (`EUREX_ASIAN_HOURS`) — the Asian-hours open. The key selects through the same `eurex_profile_at` function as the `eurex` exchange row, so the boundary is shared; the seasonal CET/CEST table is a UTC-offset comparison beside it and asserts no day.

## Holidays

**Coverage:** 2026-01-01..2026-12-31 (inclusive trade dates). Tier: T1 throughout.

One table serves `Exchange::Eurex`, the `eurex` key and the `eurex_fixed_income` key. The operator states the closure for “all derivatives”, which covers FESX, FDAX and FDXM behind the index rows and FGBL, FGBM, FGBS and FGBX behind the fixed-income rows alike, so the venue intersection is the same table.

### 2026

| Trade date | Kind | Instant as printed | Document | Tier | Derived from |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-01-01 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading and clearing (exercise, settlement and cash) in all derivatives.` | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-01-01 (New Year's Day); one Berlin civil day per trade date, so the conversion is the identity |
| 2026-04-03 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading and clearing (exercise, settlement and cash) in all derivatives.` | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-04-03 (Good Friday) |
| 2026-04-06 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading and clearing (exercise, settlement and cash) in all derivatives.` | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-04-06 (Easter Monday) |
| 2026-05-01 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading and clearing (exercise, settlement and cash) in all derivatives.` | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-05-01 (Labour Day) |
| 2026-12-24 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading in all derivatives: 24 December, 31 December` — a full trading closure; clearing stays open | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-12-24 (Christmas Eve) |
| 2026-12-25 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading and clearing (exercise, settlement and cash) in all derivatives.` | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-12-25 (Christmas Day) |
| 2026-12-31 | closed | `Eurex is closed for trading in all derivatives: 24 December, 31 December` — a full trading closure; clearing stays open | `EUREX-HOLREG-2026` | T1 | Eurex event date 2026-12-31 (New Year's Eve) |

**Gaps, 2026:** **Eurex 2027 does not ship.** Eurex's 2027-2036 trading calendars are published “on a preliminary and indicative basis … and are subject to change”, which is not the unconditional, day-level future LAW-NO-FABRICATED-DATES requires, so the five 2027 closures the indicative CSV carries (2027-01-01, 2027-03-26, 2027-03-29, 2027-12-24, 2027-12-31) are recorded here and encoded nowhere. Closed by the Eurex “Trading Calendar 2027” PDF and the 2027 section of the Holiday regulations page. **Additional German closures are unresolved.** The Trading Calendar 2026 PDF states that Eurex “is closed for trading and exercise in German equity and equity index derivatives as well as ETF and ETC derivatives which are based on Xetra® listings: to be announced”. DAX and Mini-DAX futures are German equity index derivatives, so that line could add closures beyond the seven above for FDAX and FDXM; the day-by-day Holiday regulations page lists no German-specific 2026 closure and German Unity Day 2026-10-03 falls on a Saturday, so the practical exposure is probably nil, but the operator has not said so. Closed by a Eurex announcement resolving that line.

**Interpretive steps, 2026:** None. Eurex states its closures as whole days for “all derivatives”, every phase the crate models runs inside one Berlin civil day, and Eurex publishes no early close — 24 and 31 December are full trading closures with clearing open, not half days. So each event date is its own trade date and each row is `Closed`.

## Sources

Row review: 2026-08-22 (UTC) is the date the ledger row was last reviewed as a
whole. Per-source retrieval dates were not recorded before the 2026-09-12
migration; where a later targeted review, capture or document date is recorded
beside a source below, that date governs for that source, and dates are added
as each source is re-verified.

The row rests on the same `EU-EUREX`
documents as the `eurex` exchange row; the full annotated list is in
[`eurex.md`](eurex.md#sources). The documents that key the modelled states are:

- <https://www.eurex.com/resource/blob/296888/978b08fe3a240a0b4a8fb62a2647a197/data/cs_history_26102009_en.pdf.pdf> — the official 2009 archived contract specifications, pinning the grid in force at the January-2010 floor — T1.
- <https://www.eurex.com/resource/blob/1412768/e61a2c41d65ad165af7909002223b943/data/er18088e.pdf> — Eurex circular 088/2018 and its Annex C, effective 2018-12-10 — T1.
- <https://www.eurex.com/resource/blob/1448250/29a4179e4d28742af5d0ee85f9af89f8/data/Eurex%20Asian%20Trading%20Hours_Nov%202018.pdf> — the Asian-hours launch phase diagram, which splits pre-trading from the opening auction — T1.
- <https://www.eurex.com/resource/blob/2824010/3b94b95cdf5f31cc635294659a5e9786/data/2026_05_04_eurex_d_kontraktspezifikationen_annexe_en.pdf> — the current contract-specification Annex C — T1.
- <https://www.eurex.com/ex-en/trade/trading-hours> — Eurex trading hours, the current-schedule monitoring entry point — T1.

## Gaps and residual risks

- **No dated-history gap.** The 2009 archived specification predates the
  January-2010 floor, so the baseline is sourced through the floor and the
  horizon is the floor itself.
- **The key is seasonal, so it must be queried with an instant.** The CET and
  CEST phase tables differ by an hour at the open, and the Asian-hours open is a
  fixed 00:00 UTC instant rather than a fixed local time. A detached fixed
  snapshot carries whichever table it was built from and has no seasonal
  behaviour of its own.
- **Scope.** The key names the FESX/FDAX/FDXM benchmark-index family, not a
  venue-wide Eurex clock. Eurex fixed-income futures have their own key and
  their own dated revisions.
- **Dormant identity (LAW-SERVICE-TIERS).** A venue namespace reaches an
  `Exchange`, never a key, so no SharurPlatform adapter can reach this row and
  no family-map root points at it. It is reviewed on demand, and any future gap
  is recorded here rather than opened as an issue.
