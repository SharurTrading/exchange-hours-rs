## Gaps and residual risks

- The 2026-08-03 CAS row is keyed to a SEBI circular, the regulator's own binding instrument, rather than to an NSE circular. The NSE Closing Auction Session page restates it. Recorded here because the tier of a regulator instrument is not the venue's own statement in the strict reading of LAW-PRIMARY-SOURCES.
- The pre-open order-entry boundary is set at 09:07, the earliest second a trade could print under the random closure between the 7th and 8th minute, never later; 09:07–09:15 stays `extended` so the auction match, its trade confirmations and the transition buffer remain tradeable.
- CAS 15:15–15:35 contains order-entry-only sub-phases for CAS-eligible stocks, but the venue-wide window stays `extended` because non-eligible stocks continue continuous trading through it.
- The 09:55 grid below 2010-01-04 is sourced by the December-2009 artifacts; nothing below the January-2010 floor is reviewed.
