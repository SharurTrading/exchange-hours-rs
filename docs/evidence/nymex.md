# `nymex` — evidence

- **Kind:** `Exchange`
- **Owner module:** [`energy_metals.rs`](../../src/calendar/schedules/futures/us/energy_metals.rs)
- **Source sets:** [`US-CME-GROUP`](../schedules/sources.md#us-cme-group)
- **Ledger row:** [verification.md](../schedules/verification.md)

## Ledger basis (moved from docs/schedules/verification.md on 2026-09-12 UTC)

**Gap: order-entry** — the trading session is sourced; what is undated is a queue or post-close phase in which no trade can print. Compatibility default for the named NYMEX energy/PGM and COMEX metals family. Current matching and Pre-Open queues are primary-supported and the January-2010/2015 matching revisions are exact, but the Sunday queue's 16:15→16:00 onset day is unavailable: the 2026-08-31 review narrowed it to 2012-05-28..2012-06-07 with both CME notice channels silent across that window; dated profiles now serve the sourced Sunday 16:15–17:00 intersection from the January-2010 floor, leaving only the 16:00–16:15 quarter-hour undated. TAS/TAM/BTIC, options, and other clocks are excluded.

## Revision rows

- 2015-09-20 — T1 — CME Globex notice 20150907 — every COMEX and NYMEX close moves to 16:00 CT for trade date Monday 2015-09-21.
- 2026-08-22 — T1 — 2026-08-22 review: verified current, onset undated — knowledge-bound row widening the Sunday queue to the sourced current 16:00–17:00 CT Pre-Open.

## Gaps and residual risks

- **order-entry** — the Sunday Pre-Open's move from 16:15 to 16:00 CT has no operator-stated effective day. The 2026-08-31 review narrowed the bracket to 2012-05-28..2012-06-07 from CME's own trading-hours captures and read both CME dated notice channels in full across that window without finding an announcement, so the dated profiles serve the sourced 16:15–17:00 CT intersection and withhold only the 16:00–16:15 CT quarter-hour. Closing condition: a CME document that states the new Sunday Pre-Open in session language on a day-level effective date. Served identity, so tracked as an issue (LAW-FOLLOW-UPS-ARE-ISSUES).
- **residual risk** — the only Sunday inside the narrowed bracket is 2012-06-03; that is an observation about the bracket, not a source-stated effective day, so LAW-NO-FABRICATED-DATES keeps it out of the tables.
- **scope** — TAS/TAM/BTIC, options and other product clocks are excluded; they take their own keys when a consumer maps one.
