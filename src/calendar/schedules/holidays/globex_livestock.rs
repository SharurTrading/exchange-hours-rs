//! CME Live Cattle, Feeder Cattle and Lean Hog holiday rows, 2025-2027.
//!
//! Keyed by the crate's own venue-local trade date in `America/Chicago`
//! (design memo D1). The conversion is the identity for this family and is the
//! reason the module is short: from 2016-02-29 the grid is a flat Monday-Friday
//! 08:30-13:05 CT regular session with an 08:00-08:30 CT Pre-Open and a
//! 14:30-16:00 CT Post-Close queue, all inside one local day, so no session
//! wraps a midnight and every occurrence's trade date is its own civil date.
//! CME's event-date records therefore key one row each, and the operator's own
//! printed trade date corroborates every one of them.
//!
//! The rows come from CME's trading-hours service — the endpoint
//! `cmegroup.com/trading-hours.html` itself calls — read as bytes and saved,
//! so the whole block is **T2** under LAW-PRIMARY-SOURCES. CME publishes no T1
//! per-asset-class rendering for these years; that, the eight 2025 windows that
//! survive only in a pre-holiday capture, and the two Saturday sessions this
//! family never had are recorded as gaps in
//! [`docs/evidence/globex_livestock.md`](../../../../../docs/evidence/globex_livestock.md).
//!
//! Two shapes only: `Closed` on a full Globex closure, and `EarlyClose` on the
//! four half-days CME publishes for the family. There is no late open in this
//! window, and no row whose internal phase topology the scalar vocabulary
//! cannot state.
